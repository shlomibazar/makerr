Also, I didn't feel the seller fully understood the voice, tone, and purpose for my using the Fiverr. I had to repeat my purpose a couple of times. This seller is very responsive and with time and very detailed directions, she can provide what you're looking for.",

He asked to choose the premium package which means creation of a full LinkedIn profile from scratch. To be fair, I am going to list what are the things I have learned from him: how to put the symbol in the description, shared with me a list skills, that I have to put my full name in the first name, and how to customize my Linkedin URL. Finally, after I received the delivery, I asked if may he share with me a few versions of the “About” section. He said that he was not able to send more versions this is because I have to pay for it. Again, I have paid $50.",
